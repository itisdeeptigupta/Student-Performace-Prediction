# Student Performance Prediction

#### Introduction

Education is one of the important building blocks of one's career. Learning appropriate moral values and proper nurturing at a tender age aids educational performance and help a student build his career. Our aim is to develop models to predict studentâ€™s performance based on estimating the proportion of grades scored from their psychographic and lifestyle attributes.
